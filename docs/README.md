# About PPG Heart Rate Monitor

PPG is the most commonly used measurement of heart rate for heart rate trackers. As your heart beats, the volume of blood changes within your cardiovascular systems, including the small skin vessels such as your veins and arteries. It is this change in volume which is recorded by the PPG sensor, via a small LED light.
